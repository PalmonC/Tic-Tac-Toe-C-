# Tic-Tac-Toe-C++
My First Game. 
Probably My first and last project in Visual Studio. 
Starting from now making some progress in XCode and MAYBE Neovim

Todo List:
1)Make someday a level where you play vs the computer, whether you lose or a tie.
2)Make an actuall application with swift in XCode.
3)Give more appropriate names for variables and functions.
